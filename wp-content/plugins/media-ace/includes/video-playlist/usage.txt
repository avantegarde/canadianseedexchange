Vimeo restrictions
------------------

In brief:

To use autoplay option the "?background=1&muted=1&loop=0" parameter is necessary.
The background parameter is only supported for videos hosted by paid members.
As a result, the playlist supports only videos from PRO users. But even PRO users' videos
won't be autoplayed automatically (when one video ends). Autoplay only works when is a result of user interaction.
Other videos (from free users) can be played and should loaded fine but won't be autoplayed.
